# A common ansector class for all types in the program.
# We know four type classes: a void type - a result of
# an expression with no value; integer/unsigned type;
# an array type - the array containing fixed number of
# elements of the same type; and a struct - the record
# containing the fixed number of different types, accessible
# by fields. The last type is a pointer type which is a type
# that references another type.
